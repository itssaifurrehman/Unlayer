# Unlayer
Embeddable Drag and Drop Editor for SaaS and its integration with springBoot Application

This project has Unlayer frontend which i integrated it with the springBoot application. of course sensitive information is already removed. It calls the API of Unlayer and you can load it into your project. Start creating templates and sending it to your client. Very easy to setup. I used Apache Tomcat server to run this project.

It has all the Rest Controller Requests i.e PUT, POST, GET and DELETE. Plus i have added some extra features to check the name of template already exists in the database or not( by sending a get request) and Name validation.
